# Fixed Price Contract with Signature Validation

This PoC shows how the `FullfillOrder` transition can be extended to support validating a "signed order" before an order is fulfilled.

This would allow custom biz logic around order fulfillment to be implemented off chain. If the order is signed by a trusted party, then the fixed price contract can execute the order, otherwise the order is aborted.

This is only implemented on the `sell side`.

## Preparation

The following are needed
- isolated server image
- zli
- contract.js
    - `node init`
    - `npm install`
    - `node contract.js` - it should print the supported commands

## Wallet Addresses
The script uses the addresses autogenerated by the isolated server.
- `0xd90f2e538ce0df89c8273cad3b63ec44a3c4ed82` - contract owner, seller, signer for the orders
- `0xb028055ea3bc78d759d10663da40d171dec992aa` - buyer


## Setup

The `setup` script automates the following
1. Setups a local isolated server
2. Deploys ZRC6 contract
3. Mints 10 tokens
4. Deploys a collection contract (needed by fixed price)
5. Deploys a fixed price contract
6. Sets the fixed price contract as the spender for token 1
7. Registers a public key for verifying `signed orders`
6. Sets a `sell order` on token 1
7. Fulfills the `sell order` on token 1

At the end of this script, go to devex.zilliqa.com and add a network
(http://localhost:5555). The `FullfillOrder` transition should be successful
